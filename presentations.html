                    <p>There are essentially two groups of presenters.&nbsp; The first group includes participants 7th grade and below, while the second group includes participants 8th grade and above.&nbsp; Depending on which group the participant is in, the requirements may differ.<br></p>
                    <p>Presenters that are 7th grade and below must have a presentation that is 5-12 minutes long, and presenters 8th grade and above must have a presentation between 8-15 minutes.&nbsp; Presenters begin by presenting to their clubs.&nbsp; After club presentations, they move on to the county level.<br></p>
                    <p>In order to participate in the county presentations, participants must sign up for a particular date.&nbsp; County levels include two judges who score presentations out of a total of 103 points.&nbsp; These judges use a rubric that will be handed out during a club meeting.&nbsp; The final score is out of 100, but 3 extra points can be added if the speaker goes above and beyond the expectations.&nbsp; If participants manage to get a certain score from one or both the judges, then they will move on to the State level presentations.<br></p>
                    <p>States presentations are very different from county presentations.&nbsp; In county presentations, presenters are grouped by rooms and judged for each individual presentation.&nbsp; However, in State presentations, a single presenter in each room is selected as a winner.&nbsp; At a later time in the same day, there will be an award ceremony announcing the best presenter out of the room.<br></p>
                    <p>Now that you have a basic understanding of how presentations work, its important to realize that there are four types of presentations.&nbsp; To learn more about the types of presentations, choose the next tab.<br></p>
                </div>
                <div class="tab-pane" role="tabpanel" id="tab-2">
                    <p>There are four types of presentations: Illustrated Talks, Formal Speeches, Demonstrations, and Performing Arts.<br></p>
                    <p>An illustrated talk is the best presentation option as a beginner.&nbsp; This is basically a PowerPoint or Google Slides presentation.&nbsp;The first slide should be the title, followed by a summary slide.&nbsp; This slide should list everything that will be included in the presentation.&nbsp; Next comes the actual content of the presentation.&nbsp;At the end of every presentation, always ask the audience if they have any questions.&nbsp;&nbsp;This gives an indication to the judges that the presentation is over and they may ask questions.<br></p>
                    <p>A formal speech is something to try after a couple of years of experience presenting.&nbsp; It is not easy to keep the audience's interest, and requires a lot of skill.&nbsp;This speech should be on on a specific topic of interest.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is very similar to an illustrated talk, but doesn't include any slides or visual aids.​Keep in mind that while preparing a formal speech, it should stay focused on one topic rather than going back and forth on tangents.<br></p>
                    <p>A demonstration is a presentation where presenters take a concept and try to demonstrate it to the judges.&nbsp;&nbsp;Before performing such demonstrations, the performer must be excel at doing it themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;​While performing demonstrations, it is important to keep the audience interested.&nbsp;&nbsp;Often, audience members will start to lose focus if silence is maintained for long periods of time.​It is recommended that members have lots of experience with other types of presentations before attempting a demonstration.<br></p>
                    <p>Performing arts are a type of presentation where presenters must perform something in front of an audience.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This performance may be many different things, but it is suggested to keep the audience entertained throughout the presentation.<br></p>

                <div class="tab-pane" role="tabpanel" id="tab-3">
                    <p>The design of a presentation is perhaps one of the most crucial parts in order to gain the audience's interest.&nbsp; Below are a few key points of designing a presentation.</p>
                    <p>Putting Together A Title<br>Every presentation must include a title that brings the audience in anticipation of the subject.&nbsp;The title should not be too long, but still be related to the subject of the presentation.&nbsp; The reason it shouldn't be too long is because the title doesn't add too much content to the presentation.&nbsp;It is something short and simple, yet inspirational that the audience will remember for a long time.&nbsp;Therefore, don't overthink the title.</p>
                    <p>Images Versus Text<br>The content of the presentation should have an equal balance of images to text.&nbsp;Having a whole essay on one slide is not very entertaining to viewers, even if you just summarize the paragraphs.&nbsp;Instead, choose bullet points of 3-4 words per bullet point.&nbsp;Try limiting yourself to 4 bullet points per page, and include 1-2 images.&nbsp;These small changes will make your presentation so much more entertaining.&nbsp;That being said, don't just read what the bullet point says.&nbsp;Expand on the topic.&nbsp;Most PowerPoint platforms include notes at the bottom, where you can put the complete content until you have memorized it.</p>
                    <p>Don't Read Your Slides<br>One of the most common mistakes people tend to make is reading off their slides.&nbsp;This prevents having eye contact with the audience, and also makes you drone on and on without any fluctuation in your voice.&nbsp;However, memorizing the content will liven up your presentation.&nbsp; Memorization will also allow the presenter to answer questions from the audience more fluently.&nbsp;Actually knowing the content of your presentation without having to look through index cards will assist in answering questions that puzzle audience members.</p>
                    <p>Add Graphics To Your Slides<br>Graphics are some of the most important things you can include in your slides.&nbsp;These small changes can go a long way.&nbsp;The audience will have a better time viewing your slides. Knowing that audience members can lose interest in presentations that don't look entertaining, it is better to have animations as well.&nbsp;Any change in the style of the presentation will affect it way more than it may seem.</p>
                    <p>Make Your Slide Readable<br>A lot of presentations have a bad contrast between the color of the text and the background color.&nbsp;If the background of the slide is black, keep the text a lighter color.&nbsp;Avoid contrasting colors at all costs, as it can hurt the eye while reading.&nbsp;If necessary, highlight the text and make sure it is readable.&nbsp;However, highlighting removes some of the graphic from the slide and should be avoided unless it suits the presentation style.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="tab-pane" role="tabpanel" id="tab-4">
                    <p>1. Don't worry about your score.&nbsp;Scores don't really matter, especially the first time you present.&nbsp;Just try your best and you should be able to do well.<br><br>2. Dress formal.&nbsp;That being said, you don't have to over-do it with a suit, a coat, a tie, and whatnot.<br><br>3. Make the audience smile.&nbsp;Cracking a joke mid presentation is the best way to create a really good vibe.&nbsp;This joke should be related to your presentation, however.<br><br>4. Don't just keep a straight face the entire time.&nbsp;You can smile a bit, to lighten up the mood.<br><br>5. Show your passion for the subject.&nbsp;Choosing a subject that you are passionate about is crucial.&nbsp;The information will be really difficult to remember if you truly enjoy the subject.&nbsp;The audience can feel the mood you are conveying, and therefore it is important to really choose a topic that interests you, rather than one that may interest the audience.<br><br>6. Make eye contact with the audience.&nbsp;Eye contact is something that people normally overlook, but may be important to fully convey the message during a presentation.<br></p>
